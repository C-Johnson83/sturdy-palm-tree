                    I'm Chris Johnson, an avid RPG enthusiast with an unwavering passion for virtual adventures and a
                    profound love for anime. My favorite anime hands down is the long-running anime series "One Piece,"
                    a journey
                    I've been on since 2009.

                    In my professional life, I've dedicated countless hours to self-learning VBA scripting, and as a
                    result, I've excelled in both VBA coding and, more recently, data analytics. Notably, I proudly
                    achieved an impressive average score of 102 during a rigorous six-month bootcamp at the University
                    of Minnesota. Currently, I'm eagerly pursuing another demanding bootcamp program at the same
                    prestigious university, this time diving deep into FullStack coding.

                    The prospect of venturing into the dynamic field of web design is very exciting to me. In my
                    portfolio below, you'll discover samples of my work spanning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Data
                    Analytics, showcasing some of my diverse skill set. Please feel free to explore and get in
                    touchâ€”I'm always eager to collaborate and take on new challenges.</p>
